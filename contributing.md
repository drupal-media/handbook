# Contributing

The Drupal Media Team has been growing over the last few years and gradually gaining momentum. We are always looking for new team members to help moving things forward and there are many ways to get involved, including helping with funding, project management communications, documentation, testing and development.

##Funding

*FPO/TBA - This content needs to be written, see our [Contributing](contributing.md) section get involved.*


##Regular Contribution Sprints

The Drupal Media team holds several in-person and virtual sprints each years. All contributors are welcome, and if you are interested in participating in a sprint, but can't attend in person its generally always possible to participate remotely (often through a combination of communications on IRC and comments, patches or PRs on either Drupa.org or Github.

We generally hold sprints at the following conference/events each year:

* [DrupalCon US](https://www.drupal.org/drupalcon) (late spring, May/June)
* [NYC Camp](https://nyccamp.org) (mid-summer, generally mid-July)
* [DrupalCorn](drupalcorn.org) (late summer, generally early August)
* [MidWest Developer Summit](https://groups.drupal.org/node/455093) (late summer, generally mid-August)
* [DrupalCon Europe](https://www.drupal.org/drupalcon) (early fall, generally Sep/Oct)
* [BADCamp](http://badcamp.net) (late fall, generally late Oct/early Nov)

Our largest, longest and most focused sprint of the year generally occurs in NYC, where funding is provide to help get the team together for a dedicated week long sprint; we also aim to provide an annual update at the Media Summit (for example, see the [2014 Update](https://groups.drupal.org/node/418803)).

In addition to these sprints, we also hold regular office hours on IRC for mentoring (e.g., see [Sep 2015](https://groups.drupal.org/node/477968)) and often host virtual sprints (e.g., see [Oct](https://groups.drupal.org/node/483588), [Nov](https://groups.drupal.org/node/489203) & [Dec](https://groups.drupal.org/node/492748) 2015).

We also encourage teams that are hostig Drupal events to organize their own media sprints. Doing so is fairly straightforward as you can select issues from the cue and then organize an effort to work through them (feel free to reach out to the media team with questions about priorities to work on). For an example, see the [2015 Zurich Media sprint] (https://groups.drupal.org/node/488488) (see [blog post](http://www.md-systems.ch/en/blog/2015-10/join-the-drupal-8-media-initiative)).

##Documentation

We could almost always use help with writing new documentation and reviewing/updating existing documentation. Development skill are often not needed for this, as contributing in this way often requires just downloading/installing a module and then using it to see how it's configured and works. After which, you can likely be of assistance in either writing or updating/reviewing documentation.

You can easily contribute directly on our Drupa Media [guide repository](https://github.com/drupal-media/d8-guide/issues) by editing the files through the [GitHub](https://github.com/) interface directly in your browser. Alternatively, you can clone the repository and edit the guide in your favorite text editor or in the official [GitBook desktop app](https://www.gitbook.com/editor).

All contributions are welcome and greatly appreciated.

##Organizing & Project Management

The vast majority of the current Drupal Media team are developers, and primarily back-end modules developers. We currently don't have a program manager on the team, and most of our organizing efforts are being handled by developers in addition to or in lieu of their development efforts. Simply put, we could really using assistance on the this front from new team members, with organizational, communications or project management skills. Apart from freeing up developer time to develop, it would help our team collaborate better and stay well aligned if we had more of this sort of assistance (e.g., helping summarize the roadmap, preparing quarterly progress updates, and manage our often interdependent development tasks/projects). Please reach out to the team if you're interested in contributing this sort of invaluable assistance).

##Module Development

###D7 Backporting

As our development efforts around D8 progress there will also be lots of opportunity for new contributors to help backport some of the new D8 functionality, architecture and U/X or design patterns to D7 (where possible). At a later date we will create a roadmap around any backporting priorities/opportunities, and we'll be very grateful for assistance with this, since at the moment the current Media Team needs to stay focused on completing ongoing D8 development efforts.
