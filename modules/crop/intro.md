# Crop API

The [Crop API](https://www.drupal.org/project/crop) provides storage for all cropping solution. It is able to handle crops based on region and focal point concepts.

Examples of possible use cases:
- Storing a crop area (cropping approach) or a reference point (Focal point approach).
- Ability to handle different areas via an entity (Crop) and bundle (Crop Type) for storing different information linked to crop entities.

## Configuration

This is API module. In order to crop your images you need a UI module. First such module is [Image widget crop](https://www.drupal.org/project/image_widget_crop).

## Technical details

Initial discussion can be found on [manual crop issue queue](https://www.drupal.org/node/2368945).

## Development

We use Github pull request workflow. In order to contribute to the module please [create a pull request](https://github.com/drupal-media/crop/compare) and cross-link it with the [relevant drupal.org issue](https://www.drupal.org/project/issues/crop).
